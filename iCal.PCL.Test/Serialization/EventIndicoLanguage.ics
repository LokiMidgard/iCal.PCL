DESCRIPTION:WELCOME!\n\nThe 2015 edition of Excited QCD will take place fr
 om 8 to 14 March 2015\, 2nd week of March\, in the beautiful High Tatras m
 ountain in Slovakia. From the Slovak side\, the peaks stand out from the 
 plain in a unique scenery\, one of the most beautiful in the world. The 
  hotel Penzión Teniscentrum in Tatranska Lomnica\, Slovakia will host t
 he meeting. \nExcited QCD 2015 especially occurs right after the Schladmi
 ng Winter School and before the St Goar Workshop.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nABOUT
  THE WORKSHOP\n\nThis edition is the seventh in a series of workshops tha
 t had been previously organised in Poland\, Slovakia\, France \, Portugal 
 and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the succesful meeting in 2014\, the 
 Workshop returns to the beautiful High Tatras mountain range in 2015.\n\nT
 he workshop covers diverse aspects of QCD:\n\n(i) QCD at low energies: ex
 cited hadrons\, new resonances\, glueballs\, multiquarks.\n\n(ii) QCD at 
 high temperatures and large densities: heavy-ion collisions\, jets\, diffr
 action\, hadronisation\, quark-gluon plasma\, holography\, colour-glass co
 ndensate\, compact stars\, applications to astrophysics.\n\nEmphasis is p
 laced on new developments in theory as well as the current experimental st
 atus. Scientific atmosphere\, various discussions about different topics i
 n QCD\, active participation of many young researchers and a nice environm
 ent have been the main characteristics of the previous editions and also 
 represented the goals for the new edition. The talks are all plenary\, 25
 ' long separated by 5' for discussions and with a coffee break of 30' ever
 y two or three talks for more discussions. An extended lunch break allowed
  for longer discussions and for inspiring open-air activities.\n\n \n\nV
 ENUE\n\nThe meeting will take place in the HIgh Tatras mounatins ate Tatra
 nska Lomnica\, 888m.  The price per night at the hotel Penzión Tenisc
 entrum\, with full board (breakfast\, lunch and dinner)\, is  53 € pe
 r person in a double room and 57 €  in a single room.\n\nThe hotel has
  an ice skating ring. Nearby you can find hot springs and outdoor pools i
 n Vrbov. \n\nThe ski lift (Tatranska Lomnica) is at a distance of about 5
 00 m\, and we will arrange free transport to the slopes. The slopes star
 t at Lomnicke sedlo\, 2196 m\, and the longest slope runs 6 km downd to 
 Tatranska Lomnica\, 888 m. The same ski pass is valid on other routes nea
 rby\, for example in  Strbske Pleso.\n\n\n\n \n\nPAYMENT FOR THE HOTEL:\
