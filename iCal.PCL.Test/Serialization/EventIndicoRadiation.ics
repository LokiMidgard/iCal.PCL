DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the «RREPS-15» Symposium!\n\n  The XI Internati
 onal Symposium «Radiation from Relativistic Electrons in Periodic Structu
 res» will be held in Saint Petersburg\, Russian Federation\, September 6-
 11\, 2015\, and is organized by Saint-Petersburg State University and Toms
 k Polytechnic University\n\nThe Symposium will focus on the following topi
 cs:\n\nGeneral Aspects of Physical Phenomena and Processes Associated with
  Electromagnetic Radiation\n	Transition Radiation\n	Parametric X-Radiation
 \n	Diffraction Radiation\, Smith-Purcell Effect\n	Coherent Bremsstrahlung 
 and Channeling Radiation\n	Monochromatic X- and Gamma Beams Produced at El
 ectron Accelerators\n	Processes with Crystalline Targets\n \n\n  We hop
 e the Symposium “RREPS-15” that will be held in Saint Petersburg will 
 be as fruitful as the previous symposiums.\n\n  Co-chairmen of\n			 \n
