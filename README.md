# iCal.PCL
iCal parser in a Portable Class Library

Description
===========
When it comes to the .NET world, the DDay.iCal library is fantastic. I stronly recommend that others check this out.

This is some experiments to understand how hard it is to write such a library, and do it in a portable way
(that is, Windows Phone, etc.).
